## User story testing

See user story testing table below. All 'must have' and 'should have' user stories have passed the criteria for being met. Two user stories won't be live for assessment but it's still a pass because these were part of the testimonial feature and that was classified as a 'could have'.

## Device compatibility

Throughout development the website was tested consistently using a laptop with screen size of 14 inches, a 23 inch monitor and my own in-hand iPhone 12 Pro. Multiple different devices were selected on Chrome DevTools and the window was periodically resized to check responsiveness.
