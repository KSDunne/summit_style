5.	View individual course details so that I am informed of price, description and rating
6.	Quickly identify special offers so that I can take advantage of savings on products I want to buy
7.	See the total of my purchases at any time to avoid overspending
8.	Register for an account so that I can have a profile that is specific to me
9.	Easily log in and out to access my personal account information and to protect it once I’m finished interacting with it
10.	Easily recover my password if I forget it so that I can recover access to my account
11.	Receive an email confirmation after registering to verify my account registration was successful
12.	Have a personalised user profile so that I can view my order history, order confirmations and save payment information
13.	Quickly separate a list of clothing products from a list of courses
14.	Sort the list of offerings (clothes or courses) so that I can easily distinguish the best rated, the best priced or categorically sort products
15.	Sort a specific category of product or course so that I can find the best rated or best priced in a specific category
16.	Search for a product or course by name or description so that I can find a specific product or course
17.	Easily see what I've searched for and the number of results so that I can quickly see if the product or course I want is available here
18.	Easily select the size of a product when purchasing it so that I don’t accidentally order the wrong size of clothing
19.	View items in my cart to be purchased so that I’m aware of the total cost of items and all the items that I will receive after checkout
20.	Adjust the quantity of individual items in my cart so that I can make changes to my order before checkout if I wish to do so
21.	Easily enter my personal payment information so that I can checkout quickly
22.	Feel that my personal and payment information is safe so that I can confidentially provide the information to make a purchase
23.	View an order confirmation after checkout so that I can verify that I haven’t made any mistakes
24.	Receive an email confirmation after I make a purchase so that I can keep the confirmation for my own records

- As a store owner, I want to be able to:

25.	Add a product or course so that I can add new offerings as they become available for me to sell
